Okay, it works! How to build it?

Do I use a MVC approach.  Because it is more of an "App" than a game.
There is not a lot of movement.  If each game object is a DIV, then I get
a lot of phone compatibility for free (ie touch).

I'm not thinking of using CSS really.  But this isn't a performance intensive thing.

Also, I may want the AI to be written server side, so I can swap it out

Moving things generally, is much easier on canvas.

I'm going with canvas, because why not.

Should I make a node webkit version with multiplayer?
